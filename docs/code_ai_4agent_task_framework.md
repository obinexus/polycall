# Code AI 4-Agent Task Distribution Framework

This reference describes the multi-agent workflow used when developing LibPolyCall with automated assistance.

## Agent Roles

1. **Core Developer** – implements core C functionality, topology management and validation engine.
2. **API Developer & Integration Specialist** – maintains language bindings, daemon support and cross-language APIs.
3. **QA Engineer & Unit Test Developer** – provides unit tests, integration tests and security audits with >90% coverage targets.
4. **QA Analyst & Documentation Specialist** – ensures integration tests across bindings, produces documentation and coverage reports.

## Collaboration Process

Development proceeds in phases. Core infrastructure is built first, followed by testing frameworks, language bindings and finally documentation. Each commit is reviewed across agents to maintain code quality and consistent documentation.

## Quality Gates

- All unit tests must pass
- Test coverage should exceed 90%
- No memory leaks or thread safety issues
- Documentation must accompany public APIs

The framework encourages daily synchronization, reference to task numbers in commits and continuous reporting of test results and issues.
