# Zero-Trust Testing Framework Plan

This document outlines a proposed multi-agent testing approach for the upcoming
LibPolyCall v3.3 Zero-Trust release. The plan derives from internal notes and is
based on project search results for "OBINexus LibPolyCall testing QA specifications unit test".

## 1. Agent Roles

1. **Unit Test Framework Engineer**
   - Prepare unit test harnesses for modules such as `topology_enforcer`,
     `injection_guard`, `recovery_context`, and `entropy_cache`.
   - Configure `CMakeLists.txt` targets with address sanitizer and coverage flags.

2. **TDD Implementation Engineer**
   - Write failing unit tests for critical zero‑trust functions before adding
     implementation code.
   - Maintain coverage goals of 95% statement and 90% branch coverage.

3. **QA Test Matrix Engineer**
   - Generate a TP/TN/FP/FN matrix covering command validation and injection
     detection cases.
   - Track metrics such as precision, recall and F1‑score for security critical
     paths.

4. **Test Validation & Compliance Verifier**
   - Run memory safety tools and coverage analysis on the full suite.
   - Produce a compliance report against NASA and OBINexus standards.

## 2. Orchestration Command

Testing can be orchestrated with a future `codexai orchestrate` command:

```bash
codexai orchestrate --agents=1,2,3,4 \
  --project=libpolycall \
  --module=zero-trust-protocol \
  --compliance=nasa-jpl,obinexus \
  --output=./test_reports/ \
  --coverage-threshold=90 \
  --security-level=maximum
```

This command is illustrative only; implementation of the agents and tooling is
outside the scope of the current repository but recorded here for planning
purposes.
