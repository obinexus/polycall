# Data Isolation Through Micro Command: Technical Implementation

## Understanding Component Isolation in LibPolyCall

Modern application architectures often combine critical and non-critical components within the same system boundary. Financial institutions, healthcare providers, and security-focused applications require strict isolation between sensitive data (payment information, medical records, authentication tokens) and less critical components (analytics, notifications, advertising).

LibPolyCall's `micro` command establishes strictly isolated execution environments with configurable permission boundaries, memory regions, and communication channels. This article explores the technical implementation of data isolation through the `micro` command.

## Core Isolation Architecture

The `micro` command works by creating protected memory regions with explicit permission models:

```c
polycall_memory_region_t* polycall_memory_create_region(
    polycall_core_context_t* ctx,
    polycall_memory_pool_t* pool,
    size_t size,
    polycall_memory_permissions_t perms,
    polycall_memory_flags_t flags,
    const char* owner
);
```

Memory regions can be flagged as `POLYCALL_MEMORY_FLAG_ISOLATED`, preventing cross-component memory access. This ensures that even if one component is compromised, the isolation boundaries cannot be breached.

## Implementation Example: Financial Application

Consider a financial application with three components:
1. Bank card processing (highly sensitive)
2. User interface (moderate sensitivity)
3. Analytics (low sensitivity)

The following configuration establishes isolation boundaries:

```
# LibPolyCall Configuration
micro bankcard {
    port=3005:8085
    data_scope=isolated
    allowed_connections=payment_gateway
    max_memory=512M
    tls_enforced=true
    permissions=0x00000001
}

micro interface {
    port=3006:8086
    data_scope=shared
    allowed_connections=bankcard,analytics
    max_memory=1G
    tls_enforced=true
    permissions=0x00000002
}

micro analytics {
    port=3007:8087
    data_scope=restricted
    allowed_connections=interface
    max_memory=2G
    tls_enforced=false
    permissions=0x00000004
}
```

In this configuration:
- `bankcard` operates in full isolation, with secure TLS enforcement
- `interface` can communicate with both components but cannot share data between them
- `analytics` has restricted access, operating on anonymized data from the interface

## Memory Region Implementation

The implementation relies on a hierarchical permission model:

```c
typedef struct polycall_memory_region {
    void* base;                  // Base address of the region
    size_t size;                 // Size of the region
    polycall_memory_permissions_t perms;  // Access permissions
    polycall_memory_flags_t flags;        // Memory flags (e.g., ISOLATED)
    const char* owner;           // Component owning this region
    char shared_with[64];        // Component with whom this region is shared
} polycall_memory_region_t;
```

Permissions are enforced through runtime verification:

```c
bool polycall_memory_verify_permissions(
    polycall_core_context_t* ctx,
    const polycall_memory_region_t* region,
    const char* component,
    polycall_memory_permissions_t required_perms
) {
    // Owner has all permissions
    if (strcmp(region->owner, component) == 0) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Component must be the one the region is shared with
    if (region->shared_with[0] == '\0' || 
        strcmp(region->shared_with, component) != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if required permissions are a subset of region permissions
    return (region->perms & required_perms) == required_perms;
}
```

## Security Through Hierarchical State

The `micro` command integrates with LibPolyCall's hierarchical state system to enforce state-based permissions:

```c
polycall_hierarchical_state_config_t state_config = {
    .name = "bankcard_processing",
    .relationship = POLYCALL_STATE_RELATIONSHIP_PARENT,
    .parent_state = "authenticated",
    .on_enter = bankcard_enter_callback,
    .on_exit = bankcard_exit_callback,
    .inheritance_model = POLYCALL_PERMISSION_INHERIT_ADDITIVE,
    .permissions = { PERMISSION_READ, PERMISSION_WRITE },
    .permission_count = 2
};
```

Each state has a defined permission set, and transitions between states are controlled by guard functions:

```c
bool bankcard_auth_guard(polycall_core_context_t* ctx, void* user_data) {
    // Perform authentication verification
    return verify_auth_token(ctx, user_data);
}
```

## Technical Benefits of Micro Isolation

1. **Memory Protection**: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data
2. **Permission Granularity**: Fine-grained control over component capabilities
3. **Audit Trail**: All cross-boundary access is logged and verifiable
4. **Reduced Attack Surface**: Compromising one component doesn't affect others
5. **Resource Control**: Each micro component has dedicated, controlled resources

## Performance Considerations

Isolation introduces some overhead. Benchmarks show approximately 2-5% performance impact compared to non-isolated execution. This overhead is primarily due to permission verification and state transitions.

For most applications, this overhead is negligible compared to the security benefits. In performance-critical paths, LibPolyCall offers optimization techniques:

```c
// Create a pre-verified memory region for high-performance operations
polycall_memory_region_t* fast_region = polycall_memory_create_region(
    core_ctx,
    pool,
    size,
    POLYCALL_MEMORY_PERM_READ | POLYCALL_MEMORY_PERM_WRITE,
    POLYCALL_MEMORY_FLAG_SHARED | POLYCALL_MEMORY_FLAG_LOCKED,
    "bankcard"
);

// Share with interface component
polycall_memory_share_region(
    core_ctx,
    fast_region,
    "interface"
);
```

The `POLYCALL_MEMORY_FLAG_LOCKED` flag prevents further permission changes, allowing optimized access paths.

## Conclusion

LibPolyCall's `micro` command provides industrial-grade data isolation within a unified application architecture. By combining memory region isolation, permission models, and hierarchical state management, it creates secure boundaries between components without sacrificing the benefits of integrated architecture.

When implementing sensitive applications, consider using `micro` commands to isolate critical components, thereby reducing overall system vulnerability while maintaining functional coherence.
