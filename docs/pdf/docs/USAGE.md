1. Create the base configuration directory:
```bash
mkdir -p /opt/polycall/services/{node,python,java,go}
```

2. Create the main config.Polycallfile in your project root:
```bash
# In libpolycall/config.Polycallfile
server node 3000:8080
server python 3001:8081
network start
network_timeout=5000
workspace_root=/opt/polycall/services
```

3. Create service-specific configurations:
```bash
# In /opt/polycall/services/node/.polycallrc
port=3000:8080
server_type=node
workspace=/opt/polycall/services/node

# In /opt/polycall/services/python/.polycallrc
port=3001:8081
server_type=python
workspace=/opt/polycall/services/python
```

Now, to run PolyCall in non-interactive mode with your bindings:

1. Start the PolyCall service:
```bash
./bin/polycall -f config.Polycallfile
```

2. Start the Node.js binding server:
```bash
cd ../bindings/node-polycall/examples
node server.js
```

3. Test the connection:
```bash
# In another terminal
node test_client.js
```

To verify everything is working:

1. Check the running services:
```bash
ps aux | grep polycall # Let me explain how to set up and use the non-interactive mode with your current codebase.

First, create the necessary configuration files in your project structure:

1. Create the base configuration directory:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/polycall/services/{node,python,java,go}
```

2. Create the main config.Polycallfile in your project root:
```bash
# In libpolycall/config.Polycallfile
server node 3000:8080
server python 3001:8081
network start
network_timeout=5000
workspace_root=/opt/polycall/services
```

3. Create service-specific configurations:
```bash
# In /opt/polycall/services/node/.polycallrc
port=3000:8080
server_type=node
workspace=/opt/polycall/services/node

# In /opt/polycall/services/python/.polycallrc
port=3001:8081
server_type=python
workspace=/opt/polycall/services/python
```

Now, to run PolyCall in non-interactive mode with your bindings:

1. Start the PolyCall service:
```bash
./bin/polycall -f config.Polycallfile
```

2. Start the Node.js binding server:
```bash
cd ../bindings/node-polycall/examples
node server.js
```

3. Test the connection:
```bash
# In another terminal
node test_client.js
```

To verify everything is working:

1. Check the running services:
```bash
ps aux | grep polycall
```

2. Monitor the port mappings:
```bash
netstat -tulpn | grep polycall
```

Your Node.js binding will automatically connect to the PolyCall service through the configured port mapping (3000:8080). The PolyCall service handles the routing and communication between different language servers.

To integrate a new language binding:

1. Add its configuration to config.Polycallfile:
```
server newlang 3004:8084
```

2. Create its service directory and configuration:
```bash
mkdir -p /opt/polycall/services/newlang
echo "port=3004:8084" > /opt/polycall/services/newlang/.polycallrc
```

3. Restart the PolyCall service to apply the new configuration.

This setup allows PolyCall to act as a central coordinator for all your language bindings while maintaining clean separation between services.
