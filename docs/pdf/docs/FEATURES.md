# Proposed Features for libpolycall

## Core Protocol Enhancements

### Message Compression and Optimization
The current protocol implementation can be enhanced with adaptive compression algorithms. This would involve implementing a dynamic compression system that selects the most efficient compression method based on message type and size. For large data transfers, this could significantly reduce bandwidth usage while maintaining performance for smaller messages.

### Advanced Security Features
Implementation of enhanced security measures including:
- Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 integration for secure communication
- Certificate-based authentication with support for custom Certificate Authorities
- Hardware security module (HSM) integration for cryptographic operations
- Zero-knowledge proof capabilities for secure authentication without password transmission

### Protocol Versioning and Compatibility
Development of a more robust protocol versioning system that enables:
- Seamless backward compatibility with older protocol versions
- Graceful degradation of features when communicating with older clients
- Runtime protocol negotiation between different versions
- Automated compatibility testing across versions

## State Management Improvements

### Distributed State Synchronization
Implementation of distributed state management capabilities:
- Multi-node state synchronization with conflict resolution
- Eventual consistency support for distributed systems
