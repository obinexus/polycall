# Code AI 4-Agent Task Distribution Framework

This reference outlines the collaborative workflow used when developing LibPolyCall with multiple AI agents. The framework organizes work into four specialized roles so that core features, language bindings, and testing proceed in parallel.

## Agent Roles

1. **Core Developer**
   - Implements the topology manager and thread registration logic.
   - Builds the validation engine and trace emission system.
   - Ensures all C interfaces remain stable for language bindings.

2. **API Developer & Integration Specialist**
   - Creates language bindings for Python, Node.js, and Go.
   - Designs the public API functions and configuration parsers.
   - Adds daemon support with optional `--detach` mode.

3. **QA Engineer & Unit Test Developer**
   - Maintains the unit test suite with a coverage target above 90%.
   - Implements stress tests for thread safety and performance benchmarks.
   - Runs security audits on new code before merge.

4. **QA Analyst & Documentation Specialist**
   - Performs end‑to‑end integration testing across language bindings.
   - Writes API reference material and troubleshooting guides.
   - Generates coverage and performance reports for each release.

## Workflow Phases

1. **Core Infrastructure** – Core developer and API specialist implement the topology manager and base APIs.
2. **Testing Framework** – QA engineer and documentation specialist create unit and integration tests.
3. **Language Bindings** – All agents collaborate to ensure bindings function consistently.
4. **Documentation & Validation** – Testing and documentation finalize the release, ensuring quality gates are met.

Each phase ends with a review where agents verify code quality, coverage metrics, and documentation completeness before proceeding.
