# LibPolyCall Architecture Documentation

## Project Structure Overview

This document outlines the systematic architecture of the LibPolyCall Trial implementation, maintaining clear separation of concerns between binding logic and application projects.

```

### Separation of Concerns

**Binding Layer**: 
- Core LibPolyCall communication protocols
- Language-specific binding implementations
- State management and synchronization
- Zero-trust security enforcement

**Application Layer**:
- Concrete business logic implementations
- Professional web interfaces
- Database integration and management
- Comprehensive testing frameworks

### Development Workflow

1. **Binding Development**: Enhance language-specific bindings in `bindings/`
2. **Application Development**: Implement business logic in `projects/`
3. **Integration Testing**: Validate binding-application communication
4. **Production Deployment**: Systematic deployment using documented protocols

### Technical Standards

- **Code Quality**: Professional implementation standards with comprehensive error handling
- **Testing**: Systematic test coverage for all components
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation for all architectural components
- **Security**: Zero-trust principles consistently applied across all layers
