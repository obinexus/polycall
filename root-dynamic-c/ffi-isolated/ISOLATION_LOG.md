## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-06-30 20:46:10 UTC
- **Component**: ffi
- **Calculated Cost**: 0.78
- **Threshold**: 0.6
- **Isolation Reason**: Cost exceeded governance threshold

## Governance Decision
Component isolated due to Sinphas√© governance rules:
- Dependency complexity exceeded sustainable threshold
- Circular dependency risk identified
- Architectural reorganization required

## Migration Path
1. Update dependent components to use isolated interfaces
2. Verify single-pass compilation in new structure
3. Update build configuration to include isolated component
4. Run integration tests to verify functionality

## Compliance Verification
- [ ] Interface contracts preserved
- [ ] Build system updated
- [ ] Dependencies resolved
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
