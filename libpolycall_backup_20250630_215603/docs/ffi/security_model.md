# LibPolyCall FFI Security Model

## Overview

The Foreign Function Interface (FFI) component of LibPolyCall introduces unique security challenges by allowing code from multiple language runtimes to interact directly. This document outlines the comprehensive security model implemented to ensure isolation, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain the integrity of cross-language operations.

## Zero-Trust Security Principles

The FFI security model is built on zero-trust principles:

1. **Verify Explicitly**: Every cross-language call is verified regardless of source
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Functions and data are accessible only with specific permissions
3. **Assume Breach**: Security controls operate as if malicious code might exist in any language runtime
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against various attack vectors
5. **Complete Mediation**: All access attempts are intercepted and verified

## Security Architecture

### Core Security Components

```c
// Security context structure
typedef struct {
    polycall_core_context_t* core_ctx;
    access_control_list_t* acl;
    permission_registry_t* permissions;
    audit_log_t* audit_log;
    security_policy_t* policy;
    isolation_manager_t* isolation;
} security_context_t;
```

### 1. Access Control System

The Access Control List (ACL) manages which language runtimes can call specific functions:

```c
typedef struct {
    const char* function_id;
    const char* caller_language;
    const char* caller_context;
    permission_set_t required_permissions;
    bool enabled;
} acl_entry_t;
```

Key capabilities:
- Function-level granular permissions
- Context-aware access control
- Dynamic permission adjustment
- Default-deny policy

### 2. Memory Isolation

Memory isolation prevents unauthorized access across language boundaries:

```c
typedef struct {
    memory_region_t* regions;
    size_t region_count;
    memory_permission_t* permissions;
    isolation_policy_t policy;
} isolation_manager_t;
```

Protection mechanisms:
- Separate memory regions for each language runtime
- Explicit memory sharing with permission controls
- Copy-on-access for sensitive data
- Memory permission transitions through controlled gates

### 3. Call Validation

Every cross-language function call undergoes rigorous validation:

```c
typedef struct {
    validation_rule_t* rules;
    size_t rule_count;
    validation_hook_t* pre_hooks;
    validation_hook_t* post_hooks;
} call_validator_t;
```

Validation process:
1. **Pre-call validation**: Verify caller permissions and parameters
2. **Runtime monitoring**: Track execution within constraints
3. **Post-call validation**: Verify return values and side effects
4. **Exception handling**: Secure exception propagation

### 4. Comprehensive Auditing

All security-relevant events are logged for auditing:

```c
typedef struct {
    audit_event_t* events;
    size_t capacity;
    size_t count;
    audit_callback_t callback;
    audit_policy_t policy;
} audit_log_t;

typedef struct {
    uint64_t timestamp;
    const char* source_language;
    const char* target_language;
    const char* function_name;
    const char* action;
    security_result_t result;
    const char* details;
} audit_event_t;
```

Audit capabilities:
- Comprehensive event capture
- Tamper-evident logging
- Real-time security notifications
- Configurable verbosity levels

## Security Boundaries

### 1. Language Runtime Boundaries

Each language runtime operates within a defined security boundary:

```c
typedef struct {
    const char* language;
    isolation_level_t isolation_level;
    trust_level_t trust_level;
    security_capabilities_t capabilities;
} runtime_boundary_t;
```

Boundary enforcement:
- Memory isolation between runtimes
- Controlled data transfer points
- Runtime capability restrictions
- Trust level assignment and verification

### 2. Function Call Boundaries

Function calls across boundaries undergo security checks:

```c
typedef struct {
    const char* function_id;
    boundary_transition_t* transitions;
    size_t transition_count;
    transition_policy_t policy;
} function_boundary_t;
```

Boundary transitions:
- Parameter sanitization at boundaries
- Return value validation
- Context propagation controls
- Privilege transition management

### 3. Data Transfer Boundaries

Data transferred across boundaries is subject to security controls:

```c
typedef struct {
    data_classification_t classification;
    transfer_policy_t policy;
    sanitization_rules_t* rules;
} data_boundary_t;
```

Data security measures:
- Classification-based handling
- Data sanitization during transfer
- Information flow control
- Data provenance tracking

## Threat Mitigation

### 1. Memory Vulnerabilities

Protection against memory-related vulnerabilities:

| Vulnerability | Protection Mechanism |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Buffer Overflow | Strict bounds checking on all memory operations |
| Use-After-Free | Reference counting and region-based memory management |
| Double-Free | Ownership tracking with single-responsibility cleanup |
| Memory Leaks | Cross-runtime garbage collection coordination |
| Type Confusion | Runtime type checking on all conversions |

### 2. Control Flow Attacks

Safeguards against control flow manipulation:

| Attack Vector | Defense Mechanism |
|---------------|------------------|
| Function Pointer Hijacking | Indirect call validation |
| Return Address Manipulation | Stack protection and validation |
| Type Confusion Exploits | Runtime type enforcement |
| Callback Hijacking | Callback validation and sanitization |

### 3. Data Leakage Prevention

Mechanisms to prevent unauthorized data exposure:

| Leakage Vector | Protection Approach |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Direct Memory Access | Memory isolation and permissions |
| Covert Channels | Timing normalization and noise introduction |
| Side-Channel Leaks | Constant-time operations for sensitive data |
| Return Value Leaks | Output validation and sanitization |
| Error Message Leaks | Controlled error propagation |

## Integration with Micro Commands

The FFI security model integrates with LibPolyCall's Micro Command architecture:

### 1. Component Isolation Alignment

```c
typedef struct {
    polycall_micro_component_t* component;
    security_context_t* security_ctx;
    component_permission_t permissions;
} ffi_component_integration_t;
```

Integration points:
- Security policies derived from component isolation level
- Shared permission model between FFI and Micro Commands
- Coordinated memory isolation boundaries
- Unified audit trails

### 2. Zero-Trust Cross-Component Calls

```c
typedef struct {
    const char* source_component;
    const char* target_component;
    const char* function_name;
    verification_policy_t policy;
} component_call_verification_t;
```

Verification process:
1. Source component validation
2. Target component authorization
3. Data classification boundary enforcement
4. Call parameter validation
5. Return value verification

## Security Policy Configuration

Security policies are configurable through structured configuration:

```c
// Example security policy configuration
{
    "isolation": {
        "default": "strict",
        "javascript": "restricted",
        "python": "standard",
        "c": "trusted"
    },
    "permissions": {
        "memory_access": ["c", "rust"],
        "file_system": ["python", "node:restricted"],
        "network": ["java:authenticated", "node:restricted"]
    },
    "audit": {
        "level": "detailed",
        "store": "local",
        "rotation": "daily"
    }
}
```

Policy components:
- Language-specific trust levels
- Function-specific permission requirements
- Data classification rules
- Audit configuration
- Isolation levels

## Security Implementation Details

### 1. Runtime Isolation Mechanisms

Language runtime isolation uses multiple techniques:

- **Memory Regions**: Separate memory allocators per runtime
- **Call Gates**: Controlled entry points between runtimes
- **Resource Quotas**: Limits on resource consumption
- **Context Switching**: Clean context transitions between languages

### 2. Dynamic Permission Evaluation

Permission evaluation is context-sensitive and dynamic:

```c
polycall_core_error_t security_evaluate_permission(
    security_context_t* ctx,
    const char* source_language,
    const char* source_context,
    const char* target_function,
    permission_set_t* required_permissions,
    security_result_t* result
);
```

Evaluation factors:
- Current runtime context
- Caller identity and provenance
- Target function sensitivity
- Historical behavior patterns
- System security state

### 3. Secure Memory Sharing

When memory must be shared across boundaries:

```c
polycall_core_error_t security_share_memory(
    security_context_t* ctx,
    const char* source_language,
    const char* target_language,
    memory_region_t* region,
    memory_permission_t permissions,
    memory_sharing_policy_t policy
);
```

Sharing controls:
- Permission-based access control
- Copy-on-write for sensitive data
- Read-only sharing when possible
- Reference counting with secure cleanup

### 4. Audit Trail Implementation

The audit system captures security-relevant events:

```c
polycall_core_error_t security_audit_event(
    security_context_t* ctx,
    const char* event_type,
    const char* source_language,
    const char* target_language,
    const char* function_name,
    security_result_t result,
    const char* details
);
```

Audit features:
- Tamper-evident record keeping
- High-performance logging
- Structured data capture
- Integration with system monitoring

### 5. Secure Function Registration

Functions exposed to foreign languages undergo security vetting:

```c
polycall_core_error_t security_register_function(
    security_context_t* ctx,
    const char* function_name,
    const char* source_language,
    void* function_pointer,
    function_signature_t* signature,
    security_attributes_t* attributes
);
```

Registration controls:
- Function signature validation
- Security attribute enforcement
- Permission requirement declaration
- Execution environment constraints

### 6. Secure Deserialization

All cross-language data undergoes secure deserialization:

```c
polycall_core_error_t security_deserialize_data(
    security_context_t* ctx,
    const void* data,
    size_t data_size,
    const ffi_type_info_t* expected_type,
    void** result,
    deserialization_options_t* options
);
```

Deserialization safeguards:
- Schema validation before processing
- Resource consumption limits
- Type consistency enforcement
- Recursive depth monitoring
- Suspicious pattern detection

## Security Testing Framework

The security model includes a comprehensive testing framework:

### 1. Penetration Testing Scenarios

Systematic testing against attack scenarios:

| Test Category | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Memory Safety | Tests for memory corruption, use-after-free, etc. |
| Isolation Breach | Attempts to access resources across isolation boundaries |
| Permission Bypass | Attempts to execute functions without proper permissions |
| Type Confusion | Tests type system enforcement and conversion safety |
| Resource Exhaustion | Tests quotas and resource limits |

### 2. Fuzzing Strategy

Automated fuzzing targets critical security boundaries:

- **Input Fuzzing**: Malformed data at function boundaries
- **Type Fuzzing**: Unexpected type combinations in conversions
- **State Fuzzing**: Unusual state transitions and concurrency patterns
- **Resource Fuzzing**: Unusual allocation patterns and limits

### 3. Formal Verification Approach

Key security properties are formally specified and verified:

- **Isolation Properties**: No unauthorized cross-boundary access
- **Information Flow**: No unintended data leakage
- **Privilege Constraints**: No privilege escalation
- **Memory Safety**: No memory corruption or undefined behavior
- **Resource Constraints**: Guaranteed resource availability within defined limits
- **Type Safety**: No type confusion or invalid casting

This formal verification framework employs the following methodologies:

1. **Model Checking**: Systematic exploration of state spaces to verify safety properties
2. **Symbolic Execution**: Analysis of code paths with symbolic inputs to identify vulnerabilities
3. **Type-Based Analysis**: Formal type system verification to ensure type safety across boundaries
4. **Invariant Verification**: Mathematical proof of critical security invariants
5. **Temporal Logic**: Verification of security properties across execution sequences Safety**: No memory corruption or undefined behavior
- **Resource Constraints**: Guaranteed resource availability within defined limits
- **Type Safety**: No type confusion or invalid casting
