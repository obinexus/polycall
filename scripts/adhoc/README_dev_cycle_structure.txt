# Ad-hoc Dev Cycle Structure for Sinphasé Compliance

This folder organizes all ad-hoc scripts by software development lifecycle (SDLC) stage for TDD and waterfall compliance:

- 01-requirements: Requirements gathering, validation, and initial compliance checks
- 02-design: Design-time scripts, scaffolding, and configuration
- 03-implementation: Implementation, fixing includes/paths, code generation
- 04-testing: Test scripts, test runners, validation
- 05-compliance: Compliance and governance checks
- 06-audit: Audit, reporting, trace, and metrics
- 07-waterfall: Orchestration, full-cycle, and legacy scripts

Move all .sh, .py, and related scripts into the appropriate folders. Update Makefile and setup scripts to use these new locations for Sinphasé governance.
