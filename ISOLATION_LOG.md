# Sinphasé Isolation Log

This file tracks architectural decisions and component isolations for the OBINexus libpolycall project.

## Emergency Recovery Status

**Project Status**: Crisis Recovery Mode  
**Violation Rate**: 90% (Emergency threshold exceeded)  
**FFI Threshold**: 1026x normal limits  
**Recovery Strategy**: Sinphasé phase-gate enforcement with automated isolation  

## Governance Framework

- **Autonomous Zone**: ≤ 0.5 (Emergency lowered threshold)
- **Warning Zone**: 0.5 - 0.6  
- **Governance Zone**: > 0.6 (Automatic isolation)
- **Emergency Mode**: Active - Stricter enforcement

## Architectural Principles Enforced

✅ Single-pass compilation requirements  
✅ Acyclic dependency graphs  
✅ Bounded component complexity  
✅ Hierarchical isolation protocols  
✅ Cost-based governance checkpoints
