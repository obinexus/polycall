PolyCore v2 Quality Assurance (QA) Validation Plan

OB Nexus Computing - PolyCore v2 ProjectAuthor: OBI Heart King (Uche King)Document Type: QA Validation ProtocolVersion: Draft 1.0Target Release: PolyCore v2 Production Build

Purpose

This document defines the Quality Assurance (QA) validation plan for the PolyCore v2 framework as part of the OB Nexus Tier 3 ecosystem. The goal of this plan is to ensure systematic unit validation, integration testing, security testing, and compliance verification across the entire PolyCore v2 release lifecycle.

QA validation is mandatory to:

Enforce Zero Trust design principles at every software boundary.

Guarantee interoperability across DOP Adapter cross-language bridges (C, Python, JavaScript, Lua).

Support Tiered governance models (Tier 1-3) with formal certification of software modules.

Protect the integrity of the OB Nexus open source ecosystem.

QA Scope

Core Components Covered

PolyCore Core Framework (polycall_core)

PolyCore DOP Adapter (dop/*)

PolyCore Bridge Modules (src/bridge/python, src/bridge/node, src/bridge/lua)

PolyCore CLI Integration (micro command architecture)

Telemetry Engine and Audit Logging

Exclusions

External dependent libraries (e.g. OpenSSL) validated separately.

Third-party bridge implementations (outside certified OB Nexus builds).

QA Test Layers

Unit Testing

100% coverage required for:

polycall_dop_adapter_invoke.c

polycall_dop_adapter_security.c

polycall_dop_adapter_config_load()

Automated test framework with coverage reporting integrated.

Integration Testing

Cross-component tests for:

DOP Adapter ↔ PolyCore State Machine

DOP Adapter ↔ Telemetry Engine

DOP Adapter ↔ PolyCore CLI Invocation Flow

Cross-Language Testing

Round-trip FFI tests:

C → Python → C

C → Node.js → C

C → Lua → C

Complex data marshalling validation.

Security boundary verification on bridge boundaries.

Security Testing

Fuzz testing on all DOP Adapter FFI boundaries.

Audit logging integrity tests.

Permission policy enforcement tests across isolation levels (BASIC → PARANOID).

Performance Testing

Latency benchmarks on DOP Adapter invocation under various isolation levels.

Memory footprint validation under high-load scenarios.

Cross-language bridge performance profiling.

QA Metrics and Acceptance Criteria

Metric

Target

Unit Test Coverage

100%

Integration Test Pass Rate

100%

Security Test Pass Rate

100%

Governance and Certification

Upon successful completion of this QA validation plan:

A signed QA Certificate will be issued by OB Heart King.

Certified modules will be tagged in GitHub as polycore-v2-certified.

Only certified modules are permitted for Tier 3 OB Nexus deployments.

Next Steps

Implement automated QA pipeline in GitHub Actions.

Complete full test matrix across all supported languages.

Execute final QA validation pass prior to PolyCore v2 release.
