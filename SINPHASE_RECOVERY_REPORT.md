# Sinphasé Emergency Recovery Report

## Crisis Summary
- **Total Violations**: 70 files out of 622 (11.3%)
- **Critical Violators**: 13 files (cost > 1.5x threshold)
- **Worst Violator**: ffi_config.c (2.04x threshold)
- **Emergency Status**: ACTIVE CONTAINMENT

## Immediate Actions Taken

### ✅ Phase 1: Critical Isolation
- Isolated 13 critical violators to `root-dynamic-c/emergency-isolation/tier1-critical/`
- Created backups in `backup/pre-isolation/`
- Placed isolation markers on original locations

### ✅ Phase 2: Architecture Redesign
- Designed consolidated FFI gateway pattern
- Eliminated code duplication across emergency/lost+found/main
- Target: Single-pass FFI operations with bounded complexity

### ✅ Phase 3: Lean Implementation
- Created `ffi_gateway.c` (estimated cost: 0.35)
- Minimal interface with maximum 5 dependencies
- Single responsibility pattern enforcement

### ✅ Phase 4: Automated Refactoring
- Created refactoring tool for remaining violations
- Target: < 300 lines per file, < 5 includes
- Function-based component splitting

## Recovery Metrics

| Component | Original Cost | Target Cost | Status |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| ffi_config.c | 1.224 | 0.3 | 🔄 Refactoring |
| c_bridge.c | 1.095 | 0.5 | 🔄 Refactoring |  
| python_bridge.c | 1.083 | 0.5 | 🔄 Refactoring |
| js_bridge.c | 1.021 | 0.5 | 🔄 Refactoring |
| jvm_bridge.c | 0.975 | 0.5 | 🔄 Refactoring |

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 24 hours)
1. Complete automated refactoring of Tier 1 violators
2. Test consolidated FFI gateway
3. Update build system to use new architecture
4. Run Sinphasé cost validation on refactored components

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. Address Tier 2 violators (cost 1.0-1.5x threshold)
2. Implement single-pass compilation validation
3. Deploy governance hooks to prevent regression
4. Generate architecture compliance documentation

### Long Term (Next Month)
1. Full architectural audit
2. Implement preventive governance automation
3. Developer training on Sinphasé principles
4. Continuous compliance monitoring

## Governance Framework Status

✅ **Emergency Isolation**: Active  
✅ **GitHub Actions Enforcement**: Deployed  
✅ **Local Git Hooks**: Installed  
✅ **Cost Function Monitoring**: Active  
🔄 **Architecture Recovery**: In Progress  
⏳ **Compliance Restoration**: Pending  

## Risk Assessment

- **Current Risk**: 🔴 CRITICAL (11.3% violation rate)
- **Post-Recovery Risk**: 🟡 MODERATE (estimated < 2% violation rate)
- **Long-term Risk**: 🟢 LOW (with governance automation)
