Alex: Hey Jordan, have you heard about Polycall? It's a new library I've been exploring for API development.​

Jordan: Polycall? Can't say I have. What's it about?​

Alex: It's a framework designed to facilitate cross-language communication and distributed computing. It offers modules for authentication, networking, protocol management, and more.​

Jordan: Interesting. But we already have our API setup. Why consider Polycall?​

Alex: Well, Polycall's modular architecture allows for better scalability and maintainability. For instance, its authentication module implements Zero-Trust principles, enhancing security.​

Jordan: Security is crucial, but integrating a new library can be a hassle. How steep is the learning curve?​

Alex: It's quite manageable. The library is organized into clear modules like auth, network, protocol, and edge. Each serves a specific purpose, making it easier to integrate as needed.​

Jordan: What about performance? We can't afford latency issues.​

Alex: Polycall is built with performance in mind. It includes telemetry for monitoring and optimizing system performance. Plus, its edge computing capabilities can distribute workloads efficiently.​

Jordan: Sounds promising. But is it actively maintained?​

Alex: Yes, it's developed by Obinexus Computing. They regularly update it and offer support through their platform.​

Jordan: Alright, I'm intrigued. Let's set up a test environment and see how it fits into our workflow.
